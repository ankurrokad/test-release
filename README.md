# 2.1.2 - Refund Service Request Transactions

Refund Service Request Transactions
===================================

Clinic staff can now refund a credit card or cash transactions from the Transaction listing. The new feature allows clinic staff to choose from three options for the refund: **a full refund, a partial refund, or a refund in the form of Sparrow Health Credits**. This feature is only available for Approved Service Request Transactions.

  

This new feature gives clinic staff more control and flexibility over the refund process, making it easier to manage transactions and provide excellent customer service.
